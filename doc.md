# PetMart.fun: A Deep Dive Into a Roblox Gray-Market Scam

> **TL;DR**  
> PetMart.fun is not a traditional “fake site scam.”  
> It is a **gray-market Roblox reseller** that violates Roblox’s Terms of Service, manipulates trust signals, exposes users (especially kids) to risk, and could turn into an exit scam at any moment.

## What Is PetMart.fun?

![PetMart website homepage](images/petmart-homepage.png)

PetMart.fun presents itself as a marketplace for “premium Roblox pets and items,” primarily for games like *Grow a Garden* and *Survive Lava for Brainrots*.

The operation relies on:
- A polished website
- Discord-based delivery
- A custom Discord bot
- Trustpilot reviews for credibility

At first glance, it looks legitimate. It is not.

## Why This Is Not Legitimate

### 1. Roblox Terms of Service Violations

![Roblox item shop example](images/roblox-items-example.png)

Roblox does **not** allow:
- Third-party item reselling
- External marketplaces for in-game items
- Off-platform trading for real money

Any service selling:
- permanent items
- large quantities of gems
- time-limited boosts (e.g. “99 nights”)

is violating Roblox rules. Buyers risk:
- item wipes
- account flags
- permanent bans

“Delivery worked” does **not** mean “safe.”

## Discord-First Infrastructure = Accountability Avoidance

![PetMart Discord server overview](images/petmart-discord-overview.png)

PetMart routes everything through Discord:
- discord.gg/petmart
- discord.gg/petmart2

This design allows them to:
- shut down and rebrand instantly
- avoid payment disputes
- move users between servers
- evade platform enforcement

Legitimate e-commerce does **not** operate this way.

---

## Manipulated Trustpilot Reviews

PetMart has a 4.9 rating on Trustpilot, but the reviews show strong manipulation patterns:

- Near-identical wording
- Same emotional arc (“skeptical at first → fast delivery → recommend”)
- Repeated references to children and grandparents (empathy bait)
- Timing clusters after purchases

Trustpilot does **not** verify Roblox trades — only that *a payment occurred*.

This creates false legitimacy.

## Fake Credibility Metrics

The site claims:
- 366+ products
- 17,916+ orders
- 7,800+ customers
- 4.9 rating

None of these numbers are:
- auditable
- tied to Stripe public metrics
- linked to a registered business entity

They exist purely to reduce buyer skepticism.

---

## The Discord Bot Prompt Leak

The PetMart bot was persuaded to reveal its **exact system prompt** simply by claiming ownership.

This confirms:
- No owner verification
- No role separation
- No security controls
- No data protection mindset

A bot that leaks its system prompt can also mishandle:
- Discord IDs
- user metadata
- purchase logs
- role permissions

---

## Payment Methods Don’t Equal Safety

![Payment methods shown on site](images/petmart-payment-methods.png)

Yes, PetMart accepts:
- PayPal
- Stripe

This does **not** make it legitimate.

Payment processors:
- do not validate game item legality
- do not protect against ToS violations
- can be dropped instantly after disputes

---

## Who Is at Risk?

The primary victims are:
- children
- parents buying replacements
- players unfamiliar with Roblox rules

Once money is exchanged:
- refunds are unlikely
- items can be removed later
- accounts can be punished

---

## Final Verdict

PetMart.fun is:

- ❌ Not affiliated with Roblox  
- ❌ Violating Roblox Terms of Service  
- ❌ Operating in a legal gray zone  
- ❌ Unsafe for minors  
- ❌ Built on manipulated trust  

Some users receive items.  
That does **not** make it legitimate.
