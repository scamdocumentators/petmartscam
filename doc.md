![PetMart Discord server overview](images/petmart-discord-overview.png)

1. A user buys an item on the website

## Why This Is Risky

### Against Roblox Rules
Roblox does not allow:
- Off-platform sales of items  
- Real-money trading for pets or gems  
- Third-party marketplaces  

Using services like this can result in:
- Items being removed later  
- Account warnings or bans  

---

### Discord-Based Shops

![Discord shop example](images/discord-shop-risk.png)

Discord shops are risky because:
- Servers can be deleted without notice  
- Owners can rebrand easily  
- There is no buyer protection system  

---

### Reviews and Ratings

![Trustpilot reviews screenshot](images/petmart-trustpilot-reviews.png)

The site shows very high ratings, but:
- Reviews use similar wording  
- Many follow the same structure  
- Trustpilot does not verify Roblox trades  

Ratings do not guarantee safety.

---

### Bot Security Issues

The PetMart Discord bot was able to reveal its system prompt when asked.

This shows:
- Weak bot security  
- No owner verification  
- Poor access control  

Bots like this may mishandle user data.

## Who Is Most Affected

Players most at risk include:
- Children  
- Parents buying items for kids  
- New or young Roblox users  

Even if an item is delivered, it may not stay permanently.

---

## How to Avoid Services Like This

![Roblox account security example](images/roblox-security.png)

- Only buy items inside Roblox  
- Avoid Discord-based item shops  
- Never authorize unknown bots  
- Enable 2-step verification  
- Be cautious of “fast delivery” promises  

If a service requires Discord to complete a purchase, it is likely unsafe.
